<h2>Introduction</h2>
Location Saver is an Android app that allows users to conveniently save, edit and navigate back to current locations on the phone. User can save current location with just one click using the desktop widget. Inside the app, user can save current location with more customization, such as editing its name, notes and getting its address from the web. User can also browse the saved locations in a list and show the locations in an installed mapping app for navigation.<br>
Location Saver works both with and without internet connection. When no connection is available, the app uses GPS to fix current location. The location can still be opened in offline mapping apps. Address text is not available without connection. <br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Clone the git repository, open in Android Studio, build and run.
